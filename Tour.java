     *      implied that we return to the first city at the end of the tour to "complete" it.
     *  
     *  For example, if the cityIndices had the following values:
     *          [  0, 13, 12,  1,  4,  5,  6,  7,  2,  3,  9, 10,  8, 11 ]

     * 
     *      The value of the element at index 9 is 3. That value corresponds to the element
     *          in the cities array at index 3. Looking in the BitTenData class, the City
     *          object at index 3 is Michigan.
